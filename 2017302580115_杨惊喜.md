## P7
The total time to get IP address: $RTT_{1}+ RTT_{2}+ ...+RTT_{n}$   
The total response time: $2RTT_{0}+RTT_{1}+RTT_{2}+...+RTT_{n}$  
## P21
We can use command `dig server`, and replace the 'server' with the host we want to test. 
If the query time returned is extremely short, we can tell that someone has sent request message to the host seconds ago.   
## P23
a.   
Distribution scheme: The server sends the file to each client in parallel (sending rate: u_s/N).  
Since the server's upload(sending to clients) rate is less than the client download rate ( u_s/N <= d_min)  
The client's receive rate is u_s/N.  
The time for each client to receive the whole file: F/(u_s/N)= NF / u_s  
The overall distribution time is NF / u_s  
b.  
Distribution scheme: The server sends the file to each client in parallel (sending rate: d_min).  
Since the aggregate rate Nd_min is less than the server's link rate u_s (Nd_min <= u_s)  
The time for each client to receive the whole file: F/d_min  
The overall distribution time is F/d_min  
c.  
D_cs= NF/u_s when u_s/N<=d_min  
D_cs=F/d_min when u_s/N>=d_min  
The minimum distribution time is in general given by max{NF/u_s, F/d_min}
