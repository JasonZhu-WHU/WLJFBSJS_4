# P23
### a.
The server transmit the file to all peers at the same time at the rate of Us/N. So each peer get the file in Us/N, which is smaller than dmin, so overall time is NF/Us.
### b.
The server transmit the file to all peers at the same time at the rate of dmin. So each peer get the file in dmin, which is smaller than Us/N, so overall time is F/dmin.
### c.
DCS = NF/us when us/N ≤ dmin. 
	DCS =F/dmin when us/N ≥ dmin  
	So DCS = max{NF/Us,F/dmin}
# P26
### a.
Yes. His first claim is possible, as long as there are enough peers staying in the swarm for a long enough time. Bob can always receive data through optimistic unchoking by other peers. 

### b.
His second claim is also true. He can run a client on each host, let each client  “free-ride,” and combine the collected chunks from the different hosts into a single file. He can even write a small scheduling program to make the different hosts ask for different chunks of the file. This is actually a kind of Sybil attack in P2P networks. 

# P28
### a.
If you run TCPClient first, then the client will attempt to make a TCP connection with a non-existent server process. A TCP connection will not be made.
### b.
UDPClient doesn't establish a TCP connection with the server. Thus, everything should work fine if you first run UDPClient, then run UDPServer, and then type some input into the keyboard.
### c.
If you use different port numbers, then the client will attempt to establish a TCP connection with the wrong process or a non-existent process. Errors will occur.
