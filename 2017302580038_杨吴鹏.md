### P28.  
> a. If TCPClient is run first, the client will try to establish a TCP connection with a non-existent server process. No TCP connection will be established.  
> b. UDPClient does not establish a TCP connection with the server. So if you run UDPClient first, then UDPServer, and then type some input on the keyboard, everything works fine.  
> c. If a different port number is used, the client will attempt to establish a TCP connection with the wrong process or a process that does not exist. An error will occur.  
### P29.  
> In the original program, UDPClient did not specify a port number when creating a socket. In this example, the code allows the underlying operating system to choose a port number. In another line, when UDPClient executes, a UDP socket with port number 5432 will be created.

> UDPServer needs to know the client port number so it can send packets back to the correct client socket. DPServer determines the client port number by decomposing the datagram received from the client. Therefore, the UDP server can use any client port number, including 5432. Therefore, UDPServer does not need to be modified.  
### P30.  
> Pros: Download files faster.  
> Disadvantage: Bandwidth may be used, which can significantly reduce download speeds for other users sharing the same physical link.
