### P22
For client-server distribution,the minimum distribution time is calculated by NF/u<sub>s</sub> and F/d<sub>min</sub>.
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>u</th>
    <th>N=10</th>
    <th>N=100</th>
    <th>N=1000</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>300 kbps</td>
    <td>7680s</td>
    <td>51200s</td>
    <td>512000s</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>700 kbps</td>
    <td>7680s</td>
    <td>51200s</td>
    <td>512000s</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2 Mbps</td>
    <td>7680s</td>
    <td>51200s</td>
    <td>512000s</td>
</table>  
  

For P2P distribution,the minimum distribution time is also determined by NF/u<sub>sum</sub>..
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>u</th>
    <th>N=10</th>
    <th>N=100</th>
    <th>N=1000</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>300 kbps</td>
    <td>7680s</td>
    <td>25904s</td>
    <td>47559s</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>700 kbps</td>
    <td>7680s</td>
    <td>15616s</td>
    <td>21525s</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2 Mbps</td>
    <td>7680s</td>
    <td>7680s</td>
    <td>7680s</td>
</table>  

### P28
a.If we run TCPClient before we run TCPServer, the TCPClient will try to connect,but to a unreachable server,thus the connection will fail.

b.If we run UDPClient before we run UDPServer, the UDPClient will run successfully and the connection will work regularly.

c.If we use different port numbers for client and server sides, the connection will fail,maybe an error will happen.

### P29
It's not necessary to change,because the UDPClient can send the port number through datagram to UDPServer.

The port number for socket in UDPClient and UDPServer is 5432.

Before making this change, the port number for socket in UDPClient is decided by the operating system,the port number for socket in UDPServer is unknown.
