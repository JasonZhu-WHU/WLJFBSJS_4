**p14**

SMTP

uses a line containing only one periond to mark the end of message body.

HTTP

uses "Content-Length header field" to indicate the length of message.  The length can indicate the end of message body.

No, cuz HTTP message could be binary data, whereas in SMTP, the message body must be in 7-bit ASCâ…¡ format.

**P21**

We can use command `dig server`, and replace the 'server' with the host we want to test. If the query time returned is extremely short, we can tell that someone has sent request message to the host seconds ago. 

**P25**

question a:
Possible. Because if the number of peers is big enough, he may think that he can get a complete copy.

question b:
Possible. The client can run on each host, so that each host can finish its own "free-riding" and combine data from different hosts into a file.
