### Task 2. Problems in the second chapter

> #### Problem 7
>
>  Suppose within your Web browser you click on a link to obtain a Web page. The IP address for the associated URL is not cached in your local host, so a DNS lookup is necessary to obtain the IP address. Suppose that n DNS servers are visited before your host receives the IP address from DNS; the successive visits incur an RTT of RTT1,...,RTTn. Further suppose that the Web page associated with the link contains exactly one object, consisting of a small amount of HTML text. Let RTT0 denote the RTT between the local host and the server containing the object. Assuming zero transmission time of the object, how much time elapse from when the client clicks on the link until the client receives the object?
>
> ***Answer:*** The time needed to get IP address of the target: 
>
> T<sub>get-IP-address</sub> = RTT<sub>1</sub>+RTT<sub>2</sub>+...RTT<sub>n</sub>
>
> The time elapse from when the client clicks on the link until the client receives the object: T<sub>all</sub> = 2RTT0+RTT<sub>1</sub>+RTT<sub>2</sub>+...RTT<sub>n</sub>

> #### Problem 21
>
> Suppose that your department has a local DNS server for all computers in the department. Your are an ordinary user. Can you determine if an external Web site was likely accessed from a computer in your department a couple of seconds ago? Explain.
>
> ***Answer:*** Yes, we can query the website through `dig+domain name` command in the local DNS server. If this is an address that has just been visited, then the entry of this website will be stored in the local DNS cache with an extremely short query time; otherwise, it will take a long query time.

> #### Problem 23
>
> Consider distributing a file of F bits to N peers using a client-server architecture. Assume a fluid model where the server can simultaneously transmit to multiple peers, transmitting to each peer at different rates, as long as the conbined rate dose not exceed u<sub>s</sub>.
>
> > a. Suppose that u<sub>s</sub>/N≤d<sub>min</sub>. Specify a distribution scheme that has a distribution time of NF/u<sub>s</sub>
>
> ***Answer:*** The distribution scheme is that the server sends the file of F bits to each clients in parallel at the same uploading rate of u<sub>s</sub>/N. Because u<sub>s</sub>/N≤d<sub>min</sub>, the clients are downloading files at the speed of u<sub>s</sub>/N, at the same time. Thus the distribution time is F/(u<sub>s</sub>/N)=NF/u<sub>s</sub>.
>
> > b.Suppose that u<sub>s</sub>/N≥d<sub>min</sub>. Specify a distribution scheme that has a distribution time of F/d<sub>min</sub>
>
> ***Answer:*** The distribution scheme is that the server sends the file of F bits to each clients in parallel while the clients are downloading files at the speed of d<sub>min</sub> in the meantime. Because u<sub>s</sub>/N≥d<sub>min</sub>, the servers can send files at the speed of d<sub>min</sub>. Thus the distribution time is F/d<sub>min</sub>.
>
> > c. Conclude that the minimum distribution time is in general given by max{NF/u<sub>s</sub>,F/d<sub>min</sub>}.
>
> ***Answer:*** From (a) and (b), the distribution time will be longer if the distribution scheme changes. Thus we can get:
>
> When u<sub>s</sub>/N≤d<sub>min</sub>, NF/u<sub>s</sub>≥F/d<sub>min</sub>, that is the minimum distribution time is NF/u<sub>s</sub>=max{NF/u<sub>s</sub>,F/d<sub>min</sub>};
>
> When u<sub>s</sub>/N≥d<sub>min</sub>, NF/u<sub>s</sub>≤F/d<sub>min</sub>, that is the minimum distribution time is F/d<sub>min</sub>=max{NF/u<sub>s</sub>,F/d<sub>min</sub>};
>
> Therefore, the minimum distribution time is in general given by max{NF/u<sub>s</sub>,F/d<sub>min</sub>}.
