## P14.
SMTP uses a line with only one period to mark the end of the style, and HTTP uses the content length flag.

No, because the message content may contain periods.

## P23.

### a.

The server sends files to each client in parallel at a rate of us / n

Us / N < = Dmin, so the client downloads at this rate.

Then the time for each client to receive the file is f / (US / N) = NF / us

### b.
The server sends files to each client in parallel at a rate of Dmin

Because US / N > = Dmin, that is, US > = ndmin, the server uses Dmin as the download rate

Therefore, the receiving time is f / Dmin

### c.
When us / N < = Dmin:
        N/us >= 1/dmin

        NF/us >= F/dmin
At this time, t = NF / us = max {NF / us, f / Dmin}
When us / N > = Dmin:

        N/us <= 1/dmin

        NF/us <= F/dmin

In this case, t = f / Dmin = max {NF / us, f / Dmin}
Therefore, the minimum distribution time is Max {NF / us, f / Dmin}

## P31.
a) If you run the TCP client first, the client attempts to establish a TCP connection with a server process that does not exist.
A TCP connection will not be established.



b) The UDP client has no TCP connection with the server. So if you run the UDP client first, everything should work. 
Then run udpserver and type some input on the keyboard.



c) If you use a different port number, clienl attempts to establish a TCP connection with the wrong process or a non-existent process.
An error will occur.
