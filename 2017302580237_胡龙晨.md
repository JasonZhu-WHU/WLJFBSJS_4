## Exercises
### T23

(a)Consider a distribution scenario where the server sends files to each client in parallel at the rate of u<sub>s</sub>/N.Due to we suppose u<sub>s</sub>/N<=d<sub>min</sub>, the server sends files at a slower rate than the client per download.Therefore, each client can also receive at the rate of u<sub>s</sub>/N.The time each client receives the entire file is F/(u<sub>s</sub>/N)=NF/u<sub>s</sub>.Since all clients receive files in NF/u<sub>s</sub>, the total distribution time is also NF/u<sub>s</sub>.

(b)Consider a distribution scheme in which the server sends files to each client in parallel at a rate of d<sub>min</sub>.Due to we suppose u<sub>s</sub>/N>=d<sub>min</sub>.Since each client receives at the rate of d<sub>min</sub>, each client receives the entire file in F/d<sub>min<sub>.

(c)D<sub>CS</sub>>=max{NF/u<sub>s</sub>,F/d<sub>min</sub>}  

Suppose u<sub>s</sub>/N<=d<sub>min</sub>, we can get D<sub>CS</sub>>=NF/u<sub>s</sub>

From (a) we can get D<sub>CS</sub><=NF/u<sub>s</sub>, so we get D<sub>CS</sub>=F/d<sub>min</sub> (when u<sub>s</sub>/N>=d<sub>min</sub>)

### T24     

(a)Define u = u<sub>1</sub>+u<sub>2</sub>+...+u<sub>n</sub> . Assuming u<sub>s</sub><=(u<sub>s</sub>+u)/N

Divide the file into N parts, and the i part has the size (u<sub>i</sub>/u)F.The rate at which the server transmits part i peer i is r<sub>i</sub>=(u<sub>i</sub>/u)u<sub>s</sub>

r<sub>1</sub> + r<sub>2</sub> +... +r<sub>N</sub>=u<sub>s</sub>, the aggregation server rate does not exceed the link rate of the server. It also has each peer i forwarding its received bits to each of the N-1 peers at a rate of r<sub>i</sub>. The maximum forwarding rate of peer I is (N-1)r<sub>i</sub>. So we get (N-1)r<sub>i</sub>=(N-1)(u<sub>s</sub>+u<sub>i</sub>)/u<=u<sub>i</sub>

Therefore, the total forwarding rate of node I is less than its link rate UI.

In this assignment, peer i receives bits at an aggregate rate r<sub>{i}</sub>+sum<sub>{j<i}{r<sub>j</sub>}</sub>=u<sub>s</sub>

Therefore, each peer receives the file in F/u<sub>s</sub>.

(b)Define u = u<sub>1</sub>+u<sub>2</sub>+...+u<sub>n</sub> . Assuming u<sub>s</sub>>=(u<sub>s</sub>+u)/N.Define r<sub>i</sub>=u<sub>i</sub>/(N-1). r<sub>{N+1}</sub>=(u<sub>s</sub>-u/(N-1))/N

Divide the file into N+1 parts, and the i part has the size (u<sub>i</sub>/u)F.The rate at which the server transmits part i peer i is r<sub>i</sub>=(u<sub>i</sub>/u)u<sub>s</sub> .Each peer I forwards this bit at the rate of r<sub>i</sub>to each of the other N-1 peers.

In addition, the server sends bits from the (N+1)<sup>{st}</sup> section at the rate of r<sub>{N+1}</sub >to each of the N peers. The peer does not forward the (N+1)<sup>{st}</sup> portion.

The server's aggregate send rate is r<sub>1</sub>+…+r<sub>N</sub>+Nr<sub>{N+1}</sub>=u/(N-1)+u<sub>s</sub>–u/(N-1)=u<sub>s</sub>

Therefore, the server's transmission rate does not exceed its link rate. The total transmission rate of the first pair of equipoints is (N-1)r<sub>i</sub>=u<sub>i</sub>

Therefore, the sending rate of each peer does not exceed its link rate. In this assignment, peer I receives bits at an aggregate rate,which is r<sub>i</sub>+r<sub>{N+1}</sub>+sum<sub>{j(i)}{r<sub>j</sub>}</sub>=u/(N-1)+(u<sub>s</sub>-u/(N-1))/N=(u<sub>s</sub>+u)/N

Therefore, each peer receives the files in NF/(u<sub>s</sub>+u).

(c)D<sub>{p2p}</sub>>=max{F/u<sub>s</sub>，NF/(u<sub>s<sub>+u)}.Combining a) and b) gives the expected result.
  
 ### T28
 
 (a)If TCPClient is run first, the client will attempt to connect to a nonexistent server process with TCP. No TCP connection will be made.
 
 (b)UDPClient does not establish a TCP connection to the server. So, everything should work if you run udpClient for the first time, then run udpServer, and then type in some input keyboard.
 
 (c)If a different port number is used, the client will attempt to establish a process with a TCP connection error or a process that does not exist. Errors will occur.
